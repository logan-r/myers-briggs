# myers-briggs
The purpose of this project will be to use machine learning methods to automatically infer a person’s personality from their social media posts. Using the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type/home which matches a person’s last 500 social media posts to their MBTI (Myer-Briggs Type Indicator) and text classification methods, the intent is to build a web application where the user can input a given social media account (this will initially be limited to Facebook and Twitter, but if I have enough time, could include other platforms such as Instagram and YouTube), and the info on that account will be fetch via the corresponding API. Then this data will be used to classify the user into one of the 16 personality types.
